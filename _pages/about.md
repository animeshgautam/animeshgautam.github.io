I am Animesh Gautam, a recent MBA graduate from [IIM KOZHIKODE](http://www.iitk.ac.in/) and a graduate from [IIT-ISM Dhanbad](https://www.iitism.ac.in). I have worked in Operations, Sales and marketing fields. I also have a keen interest in Digital marketing and Data analytics.

Learning and making an impact is a huge priority for me throughout. I have 11 months of work experience at Box8 as Zonal Manager, where I was handling overall outlet performance from sales target, marketing and waste management, aiming at the overall outlet and zonal profitability. In addition to this, I was leading a team of more than 50 members.

I have done my MBA Summer Internship in Corporate sales at an NBFC, OfBusiness in the retail lending, and Channel Partnerships for the white goods segment. The nature of my job at BOX8 and Summer Internship has helped me to attain skills like negotiation, communication, leadership and Team Management. I was working closely with different departments at Box8 and was steering entire sales and marketing activities for the West Zone of Mumbai.  Also, while communicating and managing my relationships with both the clients and colleagues, I was able to sharpen my oral and written communication skills. During my MBA, I've taken various classroom as well as online courses to get a formal understanding of the skills for a Sales and Marketing Manager, in addition to online courses on Digital Marketing, and hence I've prepared myself to work in such a role.

Given the opportunity, I am confident of performing well in such a role. My sincerity and organization skills are evident with my academic and professional performance, as I've performed well throughout. I love taking up new initiatives, and my work has made a lot of positive impact on the operating procedures and the way the team worked.

I maintain a list of my projects under the [Projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) tab. To get an insight into my professional life so far, you can have a look at my [CV](/images/Animesh_Gautam_CV.pdf).
