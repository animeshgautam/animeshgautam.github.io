I am Animesh Gautam, a recent MBA graduate from [IIM KOZHIKODE](http://www.iitk.ac.in/) and a graduate from [IIT-ISM Dhanbad](https://www.iitism.ac.in). I have worked in Operations, Sales and marketing fields. I also have a keen interest in Digital marketing and Data analytics.

Learning and making an impact is a huge priority for me throughout. I have 11 months of work experience at [Box8](https://box8.in) as Zonal Manager - Operations, where I handled 5 outlets in the west zone of Mumbai and was leading a team of more than 50 individuals. I ensured overall outlet and Zonal profitability which included planning out daily marketing activities, enhancing customer experience, management of outlet inventory, and above all sales while managing outlet operations with a focus on reduction in overall cost. Post which I have worked in [Tinker.ly](https://tinker.ly/) as Senior Executive Operations for 11 months where I was a part of the fulfillment and delivery operations team and was responsible for scheduling and execution of final product delivery and installation. Main KPIs included reducing the overall turnaround time for lab set up and ensuring timely delivery with a focus on customer satisfaction.   

I have done my MBA Summer Internship in Corporate sales at an NBFC, [OfBusiness](https://www.ofbusiness.com) in the retail lending, and Channel Partnerships for the white goods segment. The nature of my job and Summer Internship has helped me to attain skills like negotiation, communication, leadership and Team Management. I was working closely with different departments at Box8 and Tinker.ly.  Also, while communicating and managing my relationships with both the clients and colleagues, I was able to sharpen my oral and written communication skills. During my MBA, I've taken various classroom as well as online courses to get a formal understanding of various skills required to understand various faceit of business. I have a Lean Six Sigma - Green Belt certification from KPMG and have underwent Courses on Digital Marketing and Digital Marketing Automation.

My sincerity and organization skills are evident with my academic and professional performance, as I've performed well throughout. I love taking up new initiatives, and my work has made a lot of positive impact on the operating procedures and the way the team worked.

I maintain a list of my projects under the [Projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) tab. To get an insight into my professional life so far, you can have a look at my [CV](/images/Animesh_latest.pdf).
